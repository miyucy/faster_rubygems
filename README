A helper to dramatically speedup the time it takes to run 
require 'rubygems'
inspired by a request from Yehuda Katz [1]

Example speed difference:

bash-3.1$ time ruby examples/require_fast_start.rb

real    0m0.500s
user    0m0.031s
sys     0m0.015s
bash-3.1$ time ruby examples/require_rubygems.rb

real    0m1.109s
user    0m0.015s
sys     0m0.015s

Yea! Finally ruby script startup times that don't spend forever just reloading gem paths.

It acts about the same as gem_prelude does (prelude is 1.9 only currently) -- loads the paths of the highest version of each gem into your load path so they're ready to be required.

== installation ==

How to install (manual for now--with any interest I could make it automatic):
find your rubygems.rb file:
ex from ubuntu:
/usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8/rubygems.rb
from doze:
c:\ruby18\lib\ruby\site_ruby\1.8\rubygems.rb

git clone git://github.com/rogerdpack/faster_rubygems.git
# copy to rubygems.rb dir
cp faster_rubygems/rubygems_*.rb /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.8

== usage ==
instead of 
require 'rubygems'
it's 
require 'rubygems_fast.rb'
or
require 'rubygems_f.rb'

Though if you were really clever I suppose you could figure out how to override the default rubygem behavior to do this, instead :)


Speed difference example on linux:
$ time ruby examples/require_rubygems.rb

real    0m0.086s
user    0m0.077s
sys     0m0.008s
$ time ruby examples/require_fast_start.rb

real    0m0.026s
user    0m0.016s
sys     0m0.008s

So significant but not "such a big deal" as it is on windows boxes.  That's on warm start, however--slow start might show higher differences.  And it's still a 4x speedup :)
Note also that a few non conforming gems require the use of require 'rubygems' no matter what (they're pretty rare, though).

TODO: compare with gem_prelude speeds, too.
