A helper to dramatically speedup the time it takes to run 
require 'rubygems'

usage:
instead of 
require 'rubygems'
it's now
require 'fast_start_gems.rb'

which acts about the same as gem_prelude does on 1.9 --it loads the paths of the newest gem versions into your load path so they're ready to be required.

Example speed difference:

$ time ruby require_rubygems.rb
real    0m0.765s
user    0m0.031s
sys     0m0.015s

$ time ruby require_fast_start.rb
real    0m0.110s
user    0m0.031s
sys     0m0.015s

Finally ruby script startup times that don't spend forever just reloading gem paths.

TODO: compare with gem_prelude, too.
