A helper to dramatically speedup the time it takes to run 
require 'rubygems'
inspired by a request from Yehuda Katz [1] and gem_prelude

Example speed difference (windows box, lots of gem):

bash-3.1$ time ruby examples/require_rubygems_normal.rb

real    0m1.109s
bash-3.1$ time ruby examples/require_fast_start.rb

real    0m0.500s
bash-3.1$ time ruby examples/require_rubygems.rb

Yea! Finally ruby script startup times that don't spend forever just reloading gem paths.

It acts about the same as gem_prelude does (prelude is 1.9 only currently) -- adds the paths of the highest version of each gem into your load path so they're ready to be required.

== installation ==

ruby install.rb

== usage ==
instead of 
require 'rubygems'
it's 
require 'rubygems_f.rb'
or
require 'rubygems_fast.rb'
(both do the same thing, first is to save key strokes)

If you were really clever I suppose you could figure out how to override the default rubygem behavior to do this, always :)

Speed difference example on linux:
$ time ruby examples/require_rubygems.rb

real    0m0.086s
$ time ruby examples/require_fast_start.rb

real    0m0.026s

So overall better, but not "such a big deal" as it is on windows boxes (where it can use up to 50% of the script time).  Also note that that's on warm start--cold start might show higher differences.  And it's still a 4x speedup :)
Note also that a few non conforming gems require the use of require 'rubygems' no matter what (they're pretty rare, though--you probably won't run into them).

Note: you don't need this for ruby 1.9, which already preloads via gem_prelude (though I suppose you could replace gem_prelude with it--I'm not sure if it's much of a speedup doing that though).
